## Welcome to CCIS 1301

### Course Description
This course is an introduction to web development with HTML and CSS. In this course, students will learn about key internet technologies and standards behind the internet and world wide web. Students will develop website projects that meet current web standards and industry best practices using modern tools and techniques. The focus of this course is on the use of basic HTML and CSS as a technical foundation for later coursework in web application development using JavaScript and/or back-end technologies such as .Net or Java.

### Course Objectives
The following objectives will be addressed in the course:

- Identify key internet technologies, standards and organizations.
- Describe the client/server architecture of the internet, explaining the request-response life-cycle.
- Build HTML pages that use best practices for layout, navigation, tables, forms, images and multimedia.
- Write CSS to layout, format and enhance the display of a web page applying industry best practices.
- Develop web pages that alter the visual layout and display appropriately for presentation on devices of various sizes.
- Use a source code management tool to maintain a website.
- Understand the impact of accessibility barriers in website design and development.
- Learn and apply a current industry web development framework or library to development of a website.

## Text Book
The text book for this course is required and will be your main source for learning throughout most of the course.  The web site content will not repeat information from the text, only provide supplementary material.

Basics of Web Design: HTML5 & CSS3, Third Edition<br>
by Terry Felke-Morris<br>
ISBN-10: 0-13-397074-4<br>
</div>

While the textbook contains a code for online resources, those are not required.  This makes renting or buying used good options to reduce cost.  If you purchased a new book, consider selling it back through the bookstore at the end of the semester, or contact me if you'd like me to post it for students next semester. The book is a great learning tool, but there are better web resources for later reference use.
